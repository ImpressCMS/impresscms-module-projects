HOW TO INSTALL PROJECTS
=======================

1. Projects is installed as a regular ImpressCMS module, which means you should copy the complete /projects folder into the /modules directory of your website. Then, log in to your site as administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for the projects icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click in the install icon. Follow the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to go.

2. Projects has OPTIONAL tagging support via the Sprockets module, which must be installed separately. This enables your projects to be sorted and filtered by tag, making the module a lot more useful.
